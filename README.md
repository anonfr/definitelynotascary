# Definitely Not a Scare

A psychological thriller website that plays with expectations without delivering any actual scares.

## Setup

1. You'll need to add an audio file named `ambient.mp3` to the root directory. This should be a subtle, looping sound (like a heartbeat or distant wind).
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.

## Features

- Minimal, static design
- Creepy typography using Creepster font
- Upward-counting timer
- Subtle ambient audio (requires user interaction to start)
- Reverse psychology messaging

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses Google Fonts for the Creepster font
- Audio playback requires user interaction due to browser autoplay policies
